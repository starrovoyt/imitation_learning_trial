# Imitation learning, educational project

This is an experimental project where I'm exploring imitation learning and experimenting with the DAgger algorithm using MuJoCo and Gym.

- imitation_learning.ipynb - the main part of the code with experiments. 
- load_policy.py – agent policy.
- tf_util.py – tensorflow helper library.
